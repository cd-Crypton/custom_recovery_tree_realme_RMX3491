## Release Notes
- Decryption will now work even if lockscreen is enable. If the recovery ask you for your PIN/Pattern, just enter whatever your lockscreen was.
- Decryption now works in Generic System Image (GSI), but not yet tested in all GSI build.
- Backing up is working fine, but Restoring a backup sometimes causes a bootloop. I haven't found workaround for that.
- Backup and Restore in GSI aren't tested.
- Device known codename was RMX3491, but I used golf (...see [realme codename](https://gist.github.com/techyminati/61325feaa61526e098a124b89ddb4d15)).

## Working Features
- Decryption (...read the notes above.)
- Vibration/Haptic 
- Flashing .img/.zip
- ADB Sideload
- Terminal/Console
- MTP Enable/Disable
- FastbootD (userspace/dynamic)
- External Storage (Micro SD and USB OTG)

## Issues
- Backup/Restore (...read the notes above.)

## Backup and Restore Workaround
- When doing backup/restore, only check Data and Boot (other small partitions too), but not System nor any of the Dynamic/Super Partitions.
- It is also recommended to Format Data using stock recovery.
- It is also recommended to Reboot to System once after formatting the data, then flash back your custom recoveryâ€”then you can now Restore your Backup.
